Iteration 1: Reward Reflection:
We trained a RL policy using the provided reward function code and tracked the values of the
individual components in the reward function as well as global policy metrics such as
success rates and episode lengths after every 300 epochs and the maximum, mean, minimum
values encountered:
rotation_reward: [’0.03’, ’0.31’, ’0.30’, ’0.32’, ’0.34’, ’0.34’, ’0.34’, ’0.34’, ’0.34’, ’
0.32’], Max: 0.36, Mean: 0.32, Min: 0.03
success_rate: [’0.00’, ’0.83’, ’1.85’, ’2.89’, ’3.72’, ’4.94’, ’5.99’, ’6.90’, ’7.71’, ’8.83’
], Max: 9.29, Mean: 4.81, Min: 0.00
episode_lengths: [’7.07’, ’384.30’, ’378.22’, ’378.06’, ’406.11’, ’415.43’, ’402.64’, ’412.50’
, ’384.10’, ’434.24’], Max: 482.35, Mean: 396.02, Min: 7.07
Please carefully analyze the policy feedback and provide a new, improved reward function that
can better solve the task. Some helpful tips for analyzing the policy feedback:
(1) If the success rates are always near zero, then you must rewrite the entire reward
function
(2) If the values for a certain reward component are near identical throughout, then this
means RL is not able to optimize this component as it is written. You may consider
(a) Changing its scale or the value of its temperature parameter
(b) Re-writing the reward component
(c) Discarding the reward component
(3) If some reward component magnitude is significantly larger, then you must re-scale its
value to a proper range
Please analyze each existing reward component in the suggested manner above first, and then
write the reward function code. The output of the reward function should consist of two
items:
(1) the total reward,
(2) a dictionary of each individual reward component.
The code output should be formatted as a python code string: "‘‘‘python ... ‘‘‘".
Some helpful tips for writing the reward function code:
(1) You may find it helpful to normalize the reward to a fixed range by applying
transformations like torch.exp to the overall reward or its components
(2) If you choose to transform a reward component, then you must also introduce a
temperature parameter inside the transformation function; this parameter must be a named
variable in the reward function and it must not be an input variable. Each transformed
reward component should have its own temperature variable
(3) Make sure the type of each input variable is correctly specified; a float input
variable should not be specified as torch.Tensor
(4) Most importantly, the reward code input variables must contain only attributes of the
provided environment class definition (namely, variables
