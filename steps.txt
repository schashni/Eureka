1- ssh cluster
2- run this command on the cluster: you can change the gpu but I think the minimum will be a40-48

salloc --time=03:00:00 --gres=gpu:a40-48:1 

3- ssh to this allocated compute node

4- copy the python file you can find in API_req/LLM_API.py to the cluster 
5- run the python file LLM_API.py on the compute node 

6- then on your local machine run this command in a separated terminal:

ssh -L 5000:localhost:5000 deskoundo699@192.168.4.2 ssh -L 5000:localhost:5000 atos1 -N


change deskoundo699 to your username and atos1 to the compude node name 
and if it doesnt work, you can change 192.168.4.2 to your IP from cluster

you can find your IP from the cluster by running ifconfig on the cluster and you will find it like that:


inet 192.168.4.2



7- cd to the eureka_gemma.py python file
8- run it like that:

python eureka_gemma.py env=cartpole iteration=20 sample=3
